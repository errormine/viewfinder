# Sprint 01 Report

## Summary

Our group is working on a photo sharing social media website similar to Flickr or Instagram. During sprint 1 we laid out our plan for putting the website together, created basic designs for each page, and defined what our database schema would look like.

## Our Team

Dylan Baltrus, Daniel Lim, Andrei Neacsu, and David Singer.

## Team Compact

Our team compact was created to help faciliate collaboration and encourage the team to work together to resolve issues and overcome challenges throughout the project. The full text is available in [COMPACT.md](https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/team02m-2024/blob/main/COMPACT.md)

## Tooling

We are using Discord for communication, GitHub Projects for management, and we have a webhook in our server that logs activity in the group repo. 

## About the Project

From [ABOUT.md](https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/team02m-2024/blob/main/ABOUT.md):

We plan to create a "social media" website designed for photographers to showcase their work and discover photos from other people. It will primarly be focused on "professional" users who want to have a place to store high quality images and showcase their work. Posts which are not photographs from the person posting will be discouraged, things like advertisements or other creative work which you wouldn't normally consider photography.

Users can organize images in albums or provide tags when uploading to the website. Other users can then favorite your posts, or comment on them. Other users can also follow you to know when you post. A basic reporting system should be implemented to deal with abuse of this system. 

When viewing the website, registed users will have a few main tabs which show different types of content. The "explore" page will show posts from all users which are popular, based on some kind of algorithm. The "feed" page will show posts from users that you are following. A notification tab will show you when other users favorite your images, comment, or follow you.

Unregisted visitors will still be able to search for and view public images.

## Project Management

We decided to use Github Projects for keeping track of all of the work required to put the website together. You can see all the tasks laid out by Daniel in the [Projects tab](https://github.com/orgs/illinoistech-itm/projects/4) in our Repo. High level tasks such as each page are broken down into atomic and managable chunks which can be laid out on the kanban board.

## Website Design

Designs for each page were created in Figma, and used as a basis for the database schema. We made rough outlines for the features that we wanted to implement based on existing sites like Flickr. Here is a link to [the Figma board](https://www.figma.com/file/LAYheUrCbrUKIADzD1x7qV/Photo-sharing-platform?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=9Xs39i6trfKAgfzU-1)

## Database Schema

Our developers David and Dylan put together the database schema as well as SQL statements for use in Sprint 2. The database holds information such as the users, their photos, any albums they create, photos which they favorite, and any other information required for the function of the website. The [outline](https://github.com/illinoistech-itm/team02m-2024/blob/main/design/V2_DB_Schema.md) is available in the designs folder of the repo.

## Conclusion

Our website hopes to promote creativity and be a place where people can share something they are passionate about with others. We hope to create something fun and interesting during this semester, and learn a lot about the project development and operations lifecycle.
