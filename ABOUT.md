# About our project

## Summary
We plan to create a "social media" website designed for photographers to showcase their work and discover photos from other people. It will primarly be focused on "professional" users who want to have a place to store high quality images and showcase their work on their profile. Posts which are not explicitly creative photographs by the person posting will not be allowed, and a basic reporting system for filtering such content will be used to remove infringing posts.

Users can organize images in albums or provide tags when uploading to the website. There will be an "explore" page where users can view popular posts by other users. Users will be able to favorite posts which will save them in a private gallery for later viewing. Users will be able to follow other users and there will be a home/feed page which will show the posts from people you follow in a chronological order.

(is there anything else idk?)
