# Team Charter

## 1. Work Flow

Tasks will be assigned based on individual strengths and preferences. Regular check-ins and updates will ensure everyone is on track.
Decisions will be made via open discussion, with the aim of achieving majority consensus.

## 2. Communication Rules and Methods

We will primarily use Discord for regular communication. Responsiveness is expected from all team members.

## 3. Consequences

Each team member is accountable for meeting deadlines and fulfilling their responsibilities. 
Consistent failure to contribute will result in an open discussion to identify challenges and help overcome them. 
If issues persist, the team will consider intermediary action from Professor Hajek.

## 4. Restoration Methods

In the event of conflicts or tensions, the team will prioritize open dialogue and seek understanding. 
Our aim is to swiftly and amicably resolve conflicts.

By adhering to these guidelines, we aim to create a productive and respectful team environment.
