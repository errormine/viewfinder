# About our project

## Summary
We plan to create a "social media" website designed for photographers to showcase their work and discover photos from other people. It will primarly be focused on "professional" users who want to have a place to store high quality images and showcase their work. Posts which are not photographs from the person posting will be discouraged, things like advertisements or other creative work which you wouldn't normally consider photography.

Users can organize images in albums or provide tags when uploading to the website. Other users can then favorite your posts, or comment on them. Other users can also follow you to know see when you post. A basic reporting system should be implemented to deal with abuse of this system. 

When viewing the website, registed users will have a few main tabs which show different types of content. The "explore" page will show posts from all users which are popular, based on some kind of algorithm. The "feed" page will show posts from users that you are following. A notification tab will show you when other users favorite your images, comment, or follow you.

Unregisted visitors will still be able to search for and view public images.
